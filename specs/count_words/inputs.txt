yes please do pleaded alice
chapter iv
are you to get in at all said the footman
but at any rate he might answer questions
however jury men would have done just as well
with extras asked the mock turtle a little anxiously
presently she began again
its no business of mine
i dont believe theres an atom of meaning in it
the jury all brightened up again
who is it directed to said one of the jurymen
thank you said alice its very interesting
im getting tired of this
but about his toes the mock turtle persisted
chapter ix
alice considered a little and then said the fourth
then the dormouse shall they both cried
herald read the accusation said the king
im mad
chapter v
did you say what a pity the rabbit asked
you make me giddy
what are they doing alice whispered to the gryphon
