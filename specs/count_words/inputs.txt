im getting tired of this
id rather not the cat remarked
an invitation from the queen to play croquet
there was a dead silence
but about his toes the mock turtle persisted
i deny it said the march hare
you make me giddy
i couldnt afford to learn it
alice was silent
did you say what a pity the rabbit asked
she pitied him deeply
he must have imitated somebody elses hand said the king
i only took the regular course
i think that will be the best plan
nobody moved
there was exactly one a piece all round
alice gave a little scream of laughter
chapter i
did you say pig or fig said the cat
